# Blackjack-Game-in-Python
Blackjack simulation game in Python. Uses classes (Card, Deck, Hand, Game) to handle card creation, deck creation, player hand management and game play. Players can choose number of games and "Hit" or "Stand." Code determines winner based on hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.

# About
Blackjack is a Python-based card game simulation. The game is divided into four categories: Card, Deck, Hand, and Game. The Card class is in charge of creating individual cards, the Deck class is in charge of creating a deck of cards, the Hand class is in charge of managing a player's hand, and the Game class is in charge of game play.

# Requirements
You must have Python installed on your computer to play the game. The code may be executed through the terminal or in a Python IDE.

# How to Play
After running the code, you will be asked to specify the number of games you wish to play.
Each player is dealt two cards and can choose to "Hit" or "Stand" in each game. Each player's hand value is assessed, and the winner is selected by the closest hand value to 21 without surpassing it. The game will continue until the requested number of games are completed.
